This Streamlit app:

Loads Redmi 6 customer reviews from a CSV file.
Uses a pretrained DistilBERT model to classify each review as Positive or Negative.
Displays the results using:
A pie chart (to show sentiment distribution)
A word cloud (to show most common review words)
A table (with each review and its predicted sentiment)

| `predict_sentiment()`   | Uses DistilBERT to classify a review as positive (1) or negative (0).                                                                                                   |
| `df['sentiment'] = ...` | Applies the model to all reviews in the dataset.                                                                                                                        |
